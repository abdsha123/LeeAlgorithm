# LeeAlgorithm
This repository contains an implementation of the Lee algorithm (a variant of breadth-first search) in Python for finding the shortest path in a grid with uniform edge weights.  Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation, utilizes BFS to explore the grid and determine the shortest path.
